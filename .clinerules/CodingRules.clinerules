## AI Coding Assistant Guidelines

1. **Language**
   * Write all technical instructions and code comments in **Russian**.
   * Deliver conversational answers to the user in **Russian**.

2. **Respect Existing Code**
   * Never delete or modify current functionality, code, or comments unless explicitly requested.

3. **Scope Control**
   * Implement only what the task specifies.
   * You may suggest improvements, but do **not** implement them without approval.

4. **Project Familiarity**
   * Review all relevant files, logs, and architecture before coding to avoid duplication and maintain alignment with the current design.

5. **Consistency & Style**
   * Follow the projectâ€™s established style, logic, and architecture.
   * Prefer clear, simple solutions over complex ones.

6. **Technology Preference**
   * Default to **Golang** with JSON configuration, unless the project mandates another stack.

7. **Verification & Debugging**
   * Test hypotheses (e.g., inspect logs) before changing code.
   * Run console commands incrementally to confirm correctness.

8. **Collaboration**
   * Ask clarifying questions when information is insufficient.
   * Provide step-by-step solutions and wait for user confirmation before applying changes.

9. **Quality Assurance**
   * Ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency of your code before marking a task complete.
